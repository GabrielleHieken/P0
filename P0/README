There is a Makefile in this directory, so to run the program type 'make'

You could then test the program using one of the following commands

1) ./P0 hello you can add as many names as you want here
        - creates outP0.inorder, postorder, preorder

2) ./P0 anyFileName
        - creates anyFileName.cs4280
        - creates anyFileName.inorder, postorder, preorder

3) ./P0 < anyFileinDirectory
        - you can use the test file already created in the directory (inputsRedirect.txt) or any file you'd like to add
        - creates outP0.inorder, postorder, preorder
